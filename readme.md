Create an end point to register a user - /register

## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file. I have included a .env.sample file already in the projet where you will see the variables needed to go throuh with the process.

`CLUSTER`=

`DB`=

`collection` = 


#jwt


`secret` =

`algorithm` =

## Deployment

If you dont want to go though getting all the environment variables ready, you could always see the deployed project on RENDER (RIP HEROKUðŸ˜­ðŸ«¡)

```bash
  https://six4-task.onrender.com/docs
```
keep in mind this is my personal account on the free tier so please dont spam as i have only certain amount of storage on the DB ðŸ¥ºðŸ˜©. 

RENDER takes about 2 minuites to start up when it has 0 activity from the past 15 mins so please wait patiently as the deployed site loads (AGAIN RIP HEROKUðŸ˜­ðŸ«¡).
